# forecasting tidyverse

My project uses the tidyverts tidy tools for time-series forecasting from the fpp3 package and other tidyverse packages to make a 12-month forecast of US average unleaded gas prices from April 2020 to March 2021.  The data set was obtained from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) which is responsible for the US Department of Energy’s statistics and data. There is a wealth of data on crude oil and gasoline on the EIA’s website but it can be tricky to access it. To help with this, the EIA created an API for ease of access. I utilized the API at [eia website](www.eia.com/opendata).
